# Memory Game

A simple command-line-based memory game where players attempt to match pairs of letters on a 5x5 grid. The player wins by revealing all the matching pairs of letters.

## How It Works

- The game board is a 5x5 grid.
- Each tile on the grid is initially hidden.
- The player picks two tiles by inputting their coordinates.
- If the letters on the selected tiles match, they remain revealed.
- If the letters do not match, they are hidden again.
- The game continues until all letters are revealed, and the player wins!

## Features

- Randomly assigned letter pairs.
- Simple user input for selecting tiles.
- A win condition that checks when all tiles have been revealed.
